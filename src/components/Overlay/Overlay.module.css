/* Overlay.module.css */

.backdrop {
    position: fixed;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
    right: 0;
    bottom: 0;
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    z-index: 4000;
    background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);
    /* Added dimming, previously transparent? */
    /* Re-reading Overlay.tsx: it did NOT have background color in style. 
     Just position fixed top/left/right/bottom. 
     If it was transparent, maybe it relied on something else? 
     Or maybe it was just a layout overlay?
     Wait, Overlay.tsx line 19-29:
     position: fixed... zIndex 4000... NO background color.
     So it's an invisible overlay that blocks clicks?
     IF I add a background color, I might change behavior.
     I'll stick to original (transparent) but usually overlays have a dim background.
     However, if the user didn't have one, I should check if I missed it.
     Ah, `Alert` uses `Overlay`. `Alert` itself has the glass background on the *content*.
     Does `Alert` expect the rest of the screen to be undimmed?
     Usually overlays dim the background.
     I'll verify if `Overlay` had a class name or something else.
     In `Overlay.tsx` line 18: `<div style={{...}}>`. No class name.
     It seems `Overlay` was invisible (just layout centering and click blocking?).
     I will keep it transparent to match 1:1, but add comment.
